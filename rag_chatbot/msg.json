    "text": "\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a system architecture that enhances a Language Model (LLM) by retrieving relevant external information at query time and supplying it as context for a response. It is a pipeline that combines information retrieval with text generation, enabling language models to produce responses grounded in externally retrieved data.\n\nThe core conceptual insight of RAG is that instead of requiring an LLM to store all knowledge internally, it enables the model to:\n1. Retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source.\n2. Generate an answer using only the retrieved information and the user query. This mirrors how a human expert consults reference material before responding.\n\nA minimal RAG system consists of mandatory logical stages, which include retrieval followed by generation. All advanced RAG architectures are extensions of this base model.\n\nKey aspects of RAG include:\n*   **Document Ingestion and Knowledge Preparation:** This involves transforming raw data into RAG-ready knowledge, focusing on text extraction, normalization, chunking, and metadata. Document ingestion quality directly determines system performance.\n*   **Embeddings:** Text is transformed into numerical representations (embeddings) to enable semantic search. Embeddings encode semantic meaning and are crucial for retrieval.\n*   **Vector Databases:** Embedded knowledge is stored, indexed, and retrieved efficiently using vector databases, which are necessary for similarity search at scale to determine which information reaches the language model.\n*   **Challenges:** Poor filtering and traceability due to a lack of metadata, and meaningless embeddings from dirty text, are common RAG accuracy issues that originate in the knowledge preparation phase.\n\nRAG addresses limitations of standalone LLMs, such as the risk of hallucination, lack of awareness of real-time or updated information, and inability to ingest large documents directly due to context window limits. It provides a solution for applications requiring accurate, up-to-date, and source-grounded responses by using private or organization-specific information that would be too large to fit into a single prompt."

In RAG, a \"document\" can be pretty much any source of information that can be converted into text, like PDF files, DOCX, or TXT.\n*   **Text Extraction:** Once you have your documents, you need to pull out all the actual text from them.\n*   **Normalization:** This step involves cleaning up the extracted text. You want to make sure it's consistent and free of anything that could lead to \"dirty text,\" which can result in meaningless embeddings later on. Many RAG accuracy issues actually start here!\n*   **Chunking:** This is a really critical design decision! It's about breaking down the text into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks). These chunks are what the RAG system will use for retrieval.\n*   **Metadata:** Designing good metadata is also part of this process, as it helps with reliable retrieval and traceability.\n\nThe whole goal of these steps is to prepare a corpus of information that can then be turned into numerical representations (embeddings) for semantic search.
